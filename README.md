*p.s. The Vault is not as pretty on MacOS... deal with it*

# Dependencies
The following packages need to be installed through pip (pip3)
- PyQt5
- pyperclip
- PyCryptodome

# Key Generation
The Vault requires a 32-bit key in order to encrypt and decrypt files and the password database. Keep this saved in a .txt file somewhere safe!!! (Or write it down)

# Running the program
In your terminal run `python3 init.py` in the directory where you have this repo saved. 


# iPhone Version
There is also an iPhone version! (as you could tell from the title). For this, I used Pythonista3 to run the code (it's like $10 :( btw). For this one, you would just run the `ivault.py` script and you will get a command line interface for the methods of the desktop version.
